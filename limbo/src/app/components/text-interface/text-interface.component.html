			Finally good weather in weeks. The sun is out and strong, and its less windy than usual. Of course the cold is still there--it is always there. Even after two years living in this city, <span appHyperlink wordProperties="verb travelTo">walk</span>ing its streets, I have not gotten used to it. Call me a crybaby, but I am convinced there is something about this <span appHyperlink wordProperties="noun special">cold</span> that manages to sink into my bones, lodging itself inside of me as an ancient being. Usually, I let my incessantly busy work at the psychiatric in-patient <span appHyperlink wordProperties="noun place">building</span> to keep myself occupied, because I could attend to others, listen to their requests and nurse them back to health instead of being reminded of my own failing physiology.

			Truth to be told I've been wanting to get rid of this note book for sometime now. The more time I spend on it, jotting down events at the ward, pieces of thoughts when I eat lunch or the patients I treated, the more I feel nervous that this very act of self-reflection would lead to the discovery, half-expected at this point, that there is something deeply wrong with me. Could be this habit of aimless note taking, or could be the cold in my bones. Or the way I spend entire afternoons <span appHyperlink wordProperties="verb examine">staring</span> at a sedated man sleeping on the hospital bed, apricot colored sunlight slowing crawling across a face darkened by forgotten pain... In any case, I have my routines and its weak, yet precious balance, and I don't want to introduce any change to the system.

			In the morning, I did a routine checkup on the burn patient, which led me to believe that today is just another day I would put away to the back of my head and another page that would get buried by a thousand other identical pages, until I <span appHyperlink wordProperties="verb travelTo">walk</span>ed into the <span appHyperlink wordProperties="noun place">room</span> of <span appHyperlink wordProperties="noun person">Alan Bennet</span>.

				 ran back to my office to get my blanket and wrapped it tightly around myself. Then I poured myself a cup of hot coffee and drank it in three big gulps, burning my tongue. After I warmed up for a little bit, I read the rest of his document. On the night March 14th, Alan attempt suicide by jumping off of his 4-story apartment building when his mother was away buying groceries. Almost immediately a passerby saw the boy and called an ambulance. Doctors rushed him inside of an operation room, and fortunately, he survived. Unfortunately, the double failure of suicide and of modern medical technologies has led him to a place without answers and resolution, trapped inside of a <span appHyperlink	wordProperties="noun special">limbo</span>, half living, half dead. I realized it was time to swap Alan's IV bag.

        This afternoon, Alan's door is locked tight. I heard voices of a few doctors in a heated debate:
		"No, no, no, I have never had a single patient that showed signs of conciousness."
		"But his brain scan says he might just on the borderline. A person in permanent coma does not show this much brian activity!"
		"You know what, let just say he's having a little dream, what are we supposed to do? Wake him up?"

			I might have thrown around some bull last night but this morning I have gained back my senses. I have not forgotten my nurse training, so as long as I treated Alan like a textbook model, the banality of work would wash out my curiosity. Over<span appHyperlink wordProperties="verb think">think</span>ing was never my thing anyways. When the kid was rolled into the hospital on a bed there was no one around, no crying parents clutching his white sheets, no friends running after him, no one. Though it might change today.

				Alan's first visitor is a young college student named <span appHyperlink wordProperties="noun person">Blake Caulfield</span>. He walked into the room with sharp steps and a penetrative <span appHyperlink wordProperties="verb examine">look</span> that made me retreat aside. We exchanged a brief greeting, and then he sat down silently on a chair beside the bed.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div @textAppear *appTextPiece="gps.isUnlocked(4.2)">
			<p>
				Dressed in jacket and jeans, his body is shaped like a few bold, black brush strokes, and his eyes reflected the world in a way that gives it his own shape and color. He muttered something to the body.

				"Alan, I don't know if you can ever hear this, but I'm sorry for everything. What happened to Charlette, and what happened to you. Everything…is broken now, and there is no way to fix it." The life support beeped on in its own rhythmical language.
			</p>
			<p>
				The room fell silent again. Blake's eye never moved from Alan. The translucent blackness off his eyes casts a net over Alan's lifeless body. Alan's reflection now lives inside of Blake's eyes, as if his soul might be preserved in that dark lake of tears. I felt the need for space between the two, maybe its better to walk out of the room and take a break in the <span appHyperlink wordProperties="noun place">hallway</span>.

				"Remember Charlotte?" Blake muttered, as I quietly closed the sliding the doors to the room behind me. I felt like I was sealing away an unspeakable secret--though I have no part in it.
			</p>
			<p>
				Half an hour later I came back. Blake has left the room, but to my curiosity he left behind his <span appHyperlink wordProperties="noun object">backpack</span>, which is pack to the brim of something. I expected him to be back shortly, but he never was. I waited until midnight, yet no one has come to pick up that heavy backpack. Where could he be? The lights suddenly went out in the hallway.

        It's late at night so the hallways are all cleared up. Many sleeping bodies lied in the two rows of patient rooms on either side. The walls are as cold as morgues. Occasionally a faint white light is turned on in the hallway, revealing nothing but moving shadows. Such a <span appHyperlink wordProperties="noun person">shadow</span> limped in front of me, a few doors down the hallway, looking either drowsy or drunk.

    <div @textAppear *appTextPiece="gps.isUnlocked(4.8)">

			When I walked closer to that shadow, it collapsed onto the ground under a green <span appHyperlink wordProperties="noun special">exit</span> light by the stairs. I thought it was some careless patient, better go check on him. When I saw his face, I realized he was the Blake I met earlier. I shined a flashlight over him, but before I could check his vitals, I found myself looking at <a class="black-link" (click)="gotoLevel(4.801)"></a>

				Blake's glassy black eyes were wide <span appHyperlink wordProperties="verb interact">open</span>, pupils dialated as if deperately trying to see something. He heaved coasely, and his hair is covered in sweat even though his body is completely irresponsive. The muscles on his face started to knot up and his mouth opened up as his lips were pulled apart and exposed the teeth underneath, forming a deranged smile, or a sawing scream. There were no sounds coming out of that jagged hole on his face where his mouth used to lie, but my auditory nerves were bombarded by signals from my own brain. His laugh sounded like metal grinding on flesh.<br/>

        Persistent vegetative state. The exact same condition sent Blake into a room on the same floor, not far from Alan's. I saw him on the hospital bed earlier, perfectly inanimate but still not enough to clear up the image of his empty eyes and jeering face I saw from last night. Something must have happened between his visit with Alan and his collapse in that hallway.
